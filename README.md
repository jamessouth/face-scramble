# face-scramble

NativeScript/TypeScript/Angular app to play a [sliding block puzzle/15 puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle)

Use any picture or photo on your device (square images look best).

*NOTE:  My computer doesn't have enough RAM to build this for production, so I haven't published it yet.*

To run:

* Download and run `npm install` or `yarn`.
* Take a selfie 🤳.  For best results, set your camera app's size option to 1:1 so the image will be square.  Also, smile! 😁
* Follow the {N} install instructions [here](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/quick-setup#quick-setup).  From the App/Play stores, get the {N} Playground and {N} Preview apps.
* Now you should be able to run `tns preview` from the project root ✔.  If it doesn't work, try a different terminal (I have to run it on Windows Command Prompt instead of bash).
* On your device, open the {N} Playground app and use it to scan the QR code produced by `tns preview`.
* Face Scramble will open up in the {N} Preview app.
* Enjoy! 😃
