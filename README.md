# face-scramble
NativeScript/TypeScript/Angular app to play a [sliding block puzzle/15 puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle)

Use any picture or photo on your device (square images look best)

To run:

* Download and run `npm install` or `yarn`
* Follow the {N} install instructions [here](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/quick-setup#quick-setup).  From the App/Play stores, get the {N} Playground and {N} Preview apps
* Now you should be able to run `tns preview` from the project root.  If it doesn't work, try a different terminal (I have to run it on Windows Command Prompt instead of git bash)
* On your device, open the {N} Playground app and use it to scan the QR code
* Take a selfie
* Face Scramble will open up in the {N} Preview app
* Enjoy!
